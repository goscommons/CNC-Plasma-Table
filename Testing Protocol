Test the axes if they have accurate stepping. (They move the exact distance they supposed to) Move a specific distance and confirm with measureing tape
Find out the max speed the axes move and define it in grbl and in CAM. Maybe reduce to 80%


Check if the kerf that is cut is the same as the CAM setting. (So it can offset the paths correct)
Feed rate. Make 5 cuts of 6 inches each, with 10ipm difference. Start with 20ipm less than the suggested value. This has to be done for every material/thickness and wrote down. A Jet Tool for each ideal cut has to be made (etc. Steel 3/16" 50ipm, or Aluminum 1/4" 60ipm)
Cutting distance. Check for beveling on the side walls of the cut. Adjust the THC voltage. Wider top means the check voltage is too high, and the opposite
Pierce delay. The torch has to move just 0.1sec before the arc. 
Pierce height. Start with 0.2in and observe if the arc is wondering around. It should go right on the material
Pause at the end of the cut. Do we need it?
