# CNC Plasma Cutter
![Name of the machine](https://github.com/goscommons/CNC-Torch-Table/blob/master/01_Hardware/CAD/img/torch-table-info.jpg)
## Purpose of the machine
Many fabricators use plasma arc cutting torches every day, either to replace or complement saws, cut-off wheels, snips, and oxyfuel rigs. Fabricators say the use of this equipment has grown because it can be used in a variety of applications, from installing heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, and plumbing systems, to demolishing old industrial wash systems and erecting new ones, to cutting shapes to repair excavator booms or consistently cutting shapes.([Retrieved from the fabricator.com](https://www.thefabricator.com/article/plasmacutting/cut-it-out-how-fabricators-use-plasma-cutters-every-day))
## How the machine works
Plasma cutting is a process that cuts through electrically conductive materials by means of an accelerated jet of hot plasma. Typical materials cut with a plasma torch include steel, Stainless steel, aluminum, brass and copper, although other conductive metals may be cut as well. Plasma cutting is often used in fabrication shops, automotive repair and restoration, industrial construction, and salvage and scrapping operations. Due to the high speed and precision cuts combined with low cost, plasma cutting sees widespread use from large-scale industrial CNC applications down to small hobbyist shops([Retrieved from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cutting)).

## Use context
Plasma cutting is most widely used metal plate cutting processes for a large variety of industries. Early plasma cutting systems were used primarily for cutting stainless steel and aluminum plate from 0.5 to more than 6 in. thick. In the last 10 years, developments in plasma cutting technology have come at a fast pace with improved cut quality, automated gas flow control and the CAM software. The latest revision on high-definition machines is their full integration with the CNC machines they are coupled with.
## General specifications
The plasma cutting process needs clean air free of oil, parts and water vapor. The air compressors can leak oil, suck small particles, and they definitely condense water in the tank. Humidity in the compressed air shortens the life of the consumables of the torch. One way to get rig of the humidity is to install in line and air drying refrigerator unit, air filters, desiccants etc.
The one I made is a DIY and can get the job done with a fraction of the cost comparing similar characteristics. 
In general -more into details later-  a 4"PVC pipe right after the compressor exit -(not further downstream, but right after) filled with 1 gallon of reusable desiccant beads will hold all the moisture. The 4" diameter will slow down (bernoulli effect) the air so the beads it will have enough time to absorb the moisture. Also the cold air (due to the difference in pressure as it exits the tank) makes it easier to condense in that 4" pipe. For even better results in hot and humid climates the pipe could be installed in a refrigerator.
