## Why this license?
### Empower producers and content makers
We propose this license to allow developers and designers, decide on a case to case basis how to grant commercial attribution to potential distributors and manufacturers. For instance if some profit organizations are interested in commercializing the designs, they have to negotiate with the content owners the terms and conditions in which this will happen. For instance manufacturers might be committed to contribute back to this repo, or pay working hours to some engineers to develop a specific aspect of the design that is relevant for the further growth of this repository. Another example could be that the manufacturer can pay a fee per unit until it reaches a number of sales, etc. The terms mus be feasible, competitive and reciprocal.
### Communal valorization model
Building common pools allows us to potentially exploit common resources and create impact. For instance users of this repository might become also contribute and therefore have a say on how to use and manage these resources. But moreover communities that build content collectively, can also become economic agents, by deciding to make a business using the common resources they have created. Therefore the goal of this proposal is to empower the community and content creators, and give room for them to become competitive economic agents.
